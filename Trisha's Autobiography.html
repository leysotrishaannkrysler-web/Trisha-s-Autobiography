        <h2>Early Life and Childhood</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Trisha Ann Krysler L. Leyso, and I was born on April 20 2007 in Basak Tangke Lapu-lapu City. And i have 5 siblings and i am the 3rd child which is i am a middle child.
            Growing up, I'm a introvert kid, I personally don't like to be surrounded by large amount of people around me and i prefer to be alone. I'm also papa's girl, i really need my papa eventhough i know that he is always busy in work, i will always find a way to call or text to my papa to fetch me in school because my classmates always bullying me because of my height and last name, which is very immature fight before. My childhood memories is not that happy because at the early age, i know what is the real world, at my early age i know what is my family problems and what is our financial status. Instead of enjoying my childhood i rather be at home cleaning and taking care of my litte brother and my 9 year old sister.    
            My parents, Adonis L. Leyso, My father is a former leader as a  Private Security Guard in MEPZII in Tamiya for 23 years, he is a super hardworking papa and the most caring person in the world and sometimes he is so nonchalant, While my Mother named Diosa C. Lumongsud  is a house wife and she has sideline business which is selling hopia and chicharon in the school or sometimes in our neighborhood, I really appreciare her work but sometimes as a middle child i feel like im a human punching bag for them,but as a middle child i always understand. I have 2 older siblings named Zachary Anthea L. Lumongsud and Kryselle Heart L. Lumongsud, my older sister is working as a call center agent in Concentrix and my second older sister worked in Cebu light as a production manager, while my younger siblings named Zoe Angellee L. Leyso who is currently studying in Grade 11 and my little sister named Blessy Pearl L. Leyso who is currently studying in Grade 4 and lastly my littebrother named Kenji Sky L.

        <h2>Education and Development</h2>
        <p>
            My educational journey began at Basak Daycare Center near in  the Basak Baranggay Hall, where I got my very first academic achievement as a top 1 in our class and the most active and jolly student in the school. and where i experience to feel a true love from my parents because i worked hardc for my studies. while in my Elementary Days from Kinder to Grade 6, I always got the 2nd or 3rd honor list in my class but in my graduation day i got my parents disapointed on me because i didnt reach the highest honor in our school which where i started to working soo hard, i always studied soo hard until my eyes dropped and finally in my Highschool Year from Grade 7 to Grade 10 i got the school record as a consistent honor student in my school. not until my Senior High School year where i obviously my biggest downfall because in our school in Benthel Asia School of Technology where education is not that quite important. my consistent studies is not that quite required for my education because as Anti-Social person i really don't like to join any competitions and events in our school which is 50% is our performance task. and where i lost my confidence because it is where i got my very first line of 7 in my whole academic year and where i started to get rebelled in my studies. i started to lose interest and start working for my daily need is my families life.
            Later, I attended Lapu-lapu City College, focusing on Bachelor of Industrial Technology. 
            During these years, I developed a passion for Wedsite Coding. and as i entered the world of College, is where i started more hardwork and mental breakdown because i sustain myself for my studies i need to work as a care giver in my grandmothers house and sometimes if our school has a school payments or urgent payments i always got scolded because i dont give the payments right away and sometimesi dont eat for lunch because my budget is so very tight.
